# Decentralised Auction App

This is the third course of the Blockchain Specialization offered by University of Buffalo and The State University of New York.

This repository contains the final project I made using Truffle IDE.

# How to run?

- Git Clone the repository
- In the Command Line, get in the project directory
- If you don't have Truffle then run `npm i truffle` (make sure you have Node.js installed)
- Once it is done, run `truffle develop`
- Done, the App will be up and running
- To check if everything is working fine run `truffle test` which will check all the Test Cases.
